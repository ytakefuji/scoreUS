# scoreUS
This is a practice or exercise for students.

1. Build a program for scoring U.S. states' policies toward the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Scoring is based on the number of deaths per population (millions).

2. Then, use machine learning for understanding the relationship between its scores and other indicators.
Specify feature-importances in descending order.

Indicators such as the number of deaths, immunization rates, population, 
poverty rates, and others must be used in machine learning.

3. Examine whether the result will play a key role for policymakers in their decision-making against the pandemic.
