# scoreUS
This is a practice for students.

Build a program for scoring U.S. states' policies toward the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Scoring is based on the number of deaths per population (millions).

Then, use machine learning for understanding the relationship between its scores and other indicators.
Specify feature-importances in descending order.

Indicators such as the number of deaths, immunization rates, population, 
poverty rates, and others must be used in machine learning.
